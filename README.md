1.INTRODUCTION:

 	Business is one of the most important economy generators for each country and since the dawn of the twentieth century, all business companies turned to technology to better improve their business chances and qualities. Thus, such is the reason of the development of this system. This system is developed for the optical business, where it will be implemented in each of the shop outlets of an optical company. The system name is E-Opticals . The system is developed for the purpose of making management much more systematic and efficient.

1.1.EXISTING SYSTEM:

	This existing system of buying glasses has several disadvantages. It requires lots of time to travel to the particular shop to buy. It is having lots of manual work. Since everyone is leading busy life now a days, time means a lot to everyone. Also, there are expenses for travelling from house to shop. It is less user-friendly. In current system user must go to shop and order products. It is difficult to identify the required product. More over the shop from where we would like to buy something may not be open 24*7. Hence, we have to adjust our time with the shopkeeper’s time or vendor’s time. In current system user have to go shop to view the description of the product

1.2. PROPOSED SYSTEM:

	The proposed system helps in building a website to buy, sell optical and glasses online using internet connection. Unlike traditional commerce that is carried out physically with effort of a person to go and get glasses. This website has made it easier for human to reduce physical work and to save time. The basic concept of the application is to allow the customer to shop virtually using the Internet and allow customers to buy the glasses of their desire from the store.



2.SYSTEM SPECIFICATION:

	PROCESSOR   : Intel i3 Processor 
	RAM	    : 2GB RAM 
	HARD DISK   : 250 GB 
2.2. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS :

	FRONT END  : HTML, CSS,JAVASCRIPT 
	OPERATING SYSTEM : Windows 7/10 
	SCRIPTING LANGUAGE : PHP 
	DATABASE : MYSQL Server



3.SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION:
3.1 HYPERTEXT PRE-PROCESSOR:

	PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.
	PHP is a recursive acronym for “PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor”.
	PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
	It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
	PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record setting time.
	PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.
	PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.
	PHP Syntax is C-Like.

3.2 JAVASCRIPT:

	JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.

	Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript:

	Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.

	Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.

	Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.

	JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.

	Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.

	Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market.

	There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn Javascript Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only Javascript, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.



4.SYSTEM DESIGN:

	System design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. 
4.1. SYSTEM DESIGN INTRODUCTION:

	The purpose of the System Design process is to provide sufficient detailed data and information about the system and its system elements to enable the implementation consistent with architectural entities as defined in models and views of the system architecture 
4.2. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 

	Architectural design is the high-level structure. It is an early stage of the system design process. It represents the link between specification and design processes and carried out in parallel with some specification activities
